# hello-world
This repository is for learning GitHub and its workflow.

I am a self-taught programmer trying to break into the IT/tech space, with an eventual focus on cybersecurity.
I specialize mostly in Python/C++, but am always looking for more languages, frameworks, and systems to learn.
The purpose of this repository is to get a feel for GitHub, as well as to upload any personal projects I create.
